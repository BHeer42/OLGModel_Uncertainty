# OLGModel_Uncertainty
Computation of the prototype OLG model (with idiosyncratic income uncertainty) to study distribution macroeconomics as described in Chapter 10.1 of Heer/Maussner (3rd edition, in progress). Code available in PYTHON and GAUSS.

In this repository, you find the solution to a prototype OLG model with income heterogeneity. The model replicates the inequality in wages, income and earnings, and, to some extent, the inequality in wealth. It serves as the benchmark model in distribution macroeconomics. The detailed description of the model and the PYTHON code is available online at my web page:

In order to run the PYTHON code, you need to store the PYTHON program 'AK70_stochastic_income.py' and the Excel file 'survival_probs.xlsx' in the same working directory.

In order to run the GAUSS code, you need to store the GAUSS program 'AK70_stochastic_income.gss', the Excel file 'survival_probs_US.xls' and the auxiliary files 'toolbox.src', 'function.src' and '_tools_pck.src' in the same directory.
